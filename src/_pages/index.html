        <h2>Evolution of a Web Application</h2>
        <p>
          This is the story of <a href="https://npmjs.com">npmjs.com</a>: how it started as a special snowflake web application, got
          rewritten into an almost-modular-but-not-quite monolith, and began its next steps towards becoming a real, honest-to-goodness
          conglomeration of microservices.
        </p>
        <p>
          From zero lines of front-end JavaScript to what looks like a React-based application, I will dive into how we have managed
          to keep up with our users, anticipated their needs, and tried (and sometimes failed!) to give them a good experience.

          Chris Heilmann has dedicated a lot of his time making the web better. Originally coming from a radio
          journalism background, he built his first web site from scratch around 1997 and spent the following
          years working on lots of large, international web sites. He then spent a few years in Yahoo building
          products and explaining and training people including Yahoo Answers, Search, Local and Maps. He then
          worked at Mozilla moving HTML5 support forward and advocating Firefox OS as an open alternative to
          closed mobile systems. Chris wrote two and contributed to eight books on web development and wrote
          many articles and hundreds of blog posts for Ajaxian, Smashing Magazine, Yahoo, Mozilla, ScriptJunkie
          and many more. He also wrote the Developer Evangelism Handbook in use in many companies to coach
          evangelists. He is currently working with the Microsoft Edge team as a Program Manager for Developer Outreach

        <h2>JavaScript is a buffet, not the enemy</h2>
        <p>
          When you look at the JavaScript world these days you can get disheartened. On the one side there is an
          overwhelming offer of things you should know but are "considered harmful" by the time you have a chance
          to look at them. On the other side you have fire and brimstone talks about how relying on JavaScript
          makes you a terrible person. Let Chris set your mind at ease. Things aren't that grim or complicated.

        <p>
          Do you care about performance? Memory leaks, megamorphic cache misses, and deoptimizations
          can slow your app down. We’ll dive deep into the inner workings of V8, Chrome’s JavaScript engine,
          to better understand what these terms mean. V8 ships with its own profiling tools that can identify
          such problems. You’ll learn to identify and fix low-level JavaScript performance issues using several
          V8 developer tools.

        <h2>Introduction to Serverless</h2>
        <p>
          Serverless is a new cloud computing paradigm that abstracts users away dealing with low-level server configuration.
          It allows for auto-scaling, pay-per-execution applications on an event-driven basis. AWS Lambda its is most prominent
          vendor, but other cloud providers are catching up.
        </p>
        <p>
          This talk starts with an introduction to serverless architectures and explores the benefits and challenges coming along
          with it. It provides you with an overview of the existing ecosystem and demonstrates how to get started using NodeJS examples.
          At last the presenter will share of collection of best practices and lessons learned from his experience developing serverless
          applications.

        <h2>Coding art</h2>
        <p>
          The web platform is a wonderful playground of artistic and technical expression. The artists of the web
          often release amazing creations. As developers we can use a powerful language to bring our ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          This talk will touch on creative coding, the demoscene, a range of optimisation techniques and the creative
          mindset. Then we will code a little Audio-Visual demo together.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this will inspire new JavaScript artists and bring a dash of creativity to your every day problem solving.

    <h2 id="workshop">Workshop on January 26th</h2>
    <p class="about-box">
      A day before the event we will hold a special React workshop with our friend Nik Graf from React Vienna.
    </p>

    <section class="divider on-top" id="nik">
      <img src="/assets/images/nik.jpg" alt="Nik Graf" class="divider-image">
      <div class="divider-content">
        <h3>Workshop host: Nik Graf</h3>
        <p>
          Nik is a developer with heavy focus on UX. He co-created several popular open source projects
          like DraftJS Plugins &amp; Carte Blanche and earlier this year Nik participated in Stripe’s Open
          Source Retreat. He organises the ReactJS Vienna Meet-up and recently joined the US startup Serverless.
        </p>
        <h2>Workshop: Advanced React Topics</h2>
        <p>
          React revolutionized the way we build user interfaces for the web today. Components are everywhere and
          most front-end frameworks nowadays have adopted a Virtual DOM under the hood.
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn't stop there. The rise of React triggered a many more innovations in the front-end development
          space. With so much movement in this space sometimes many of us struggled to keep up. The term JS Fatigue
          was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nik Graf was fortunate to have used many of these new technologies over the last couple years. In this
          workshop he will guide you through four modules. Each module will start with a brief presentation into
          the topic and followed by a coding exercise.
        </p>
        <h3>Schedule</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Higher Order Components</strong>: While you probably use them on a daily basis like Redux's
            connect there are many more use-cases. Nik will explain how they work and you will build a simple
            validation library with your own higher order components.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Snapshot testing with Jest</strong>: Testing components is a tedious process and therefor
            many just don't do it. Jest's snapshot feature makes testing components quick and fun.
          </li>
          <li><strong>The Dos and Don'ts with Redux</strong>: While Redux itself is fairly simple it isn't trivial
            how to organize your code, structure your reducers nor deal with side-effects. In this module we are
            going explore the tradeoffs of several approaches.
          </li>
          <li><strong>First Steps with GraphQL</strong>: During this session you will build your first GraphQL endpoint.
            Exciting! 🤗
