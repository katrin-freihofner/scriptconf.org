    Our schedule includes two major breaks where we serve delicious cake and dinner. All session breaks are long enough
    to give you some time to refresh yourself, grab another drink and chat to your buddies.
  </p>

  <p>
    All-inclusive also goes for the after-show party. Stay with the people and enjoy the company! Soft drinks and alcoholic
    beverages are supplied!
  </p>

  <h3>An excellent line-up</h3>
  
  <p>
    All our speakers come by invitation only. We carefully curate a program that will not only fit the Zeitgeist, but also 
    give you ideas and inspiration beyond your daily work. You will get household names as well as newcomers who deserve a
    big stage!
  </p>

  <h3>A conference for everbody</h3>

  <p>
    We do our best to ensure everyone is welcome — and our wonderful attendees and speakers add their fair share to
    make the atmosphere of Script so friendly and unique. We got this family-vibe going on, and you can be part of it!

  <p>
    Script lives by the <a href="/code-of-conduct">JSConf code of conduct</a> to make sure the event is welcoming and safe
    for everyone. We keep ticket prices as low as possible and affordable. Since we are a bunch of individuals and completely
    independent, all income from Script runs directly into the conference again — and you are going to feel that!
  </p>

  <h3>100% independent</h3>

  <p>
    There is no huge company behind ScriptConf. It's organised by a couple inviduals who want to have
    the best conference experience for the community. We work closly with our partners on the event's surroundings
    to make sure this won't be another hiring competition, but an event worthwhile for everyone involved!
