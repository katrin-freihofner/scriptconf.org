        <p>
          Franziska is a software engineer at Google and a Node.js core collaborator. She works
          on the Chrome V8 team, focusing on ES6 performance and anything related to Node.js.

        <h2>Performance Profiling for V8</h2>
        <p>
          Do you care about performance? Memory leaks, megamorphic cache misses, and deoptimizations
          can slow your app down. We’ll dive deep into the inner workings of V8, Chrome’s JavaScript engine,
          to better understand what these terms mean. V8 ships with its own profiling tools that can identify
          such problems. You’ll learn to identify and fix low-level JavaScript performance issues using several
          V8 developer tools.
