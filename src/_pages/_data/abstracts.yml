    abstract:
      - "When you look at the JavaScript world these days you can get disheartened. On the one side there is an overwhelming offer of things you should know but are \"considered harmful\" by the time you have a chance to look at them. On the other side you have fire and brimstone talks about how relying on JavaScript makes you a terrible person. Let Chris set your mind at ease. Things aren't that grim or complicated."
